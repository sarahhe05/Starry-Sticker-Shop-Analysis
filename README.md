# Starry Sticker Shop Analysis âœ¨
This is an analysis of the online shop data from my small business, Starry Sticker Shop.

## Data
I downloaded sales and customer review data from 2020 to 2023 from my Etsy shop. There are a total of 266 rows representing 266 sales. I merged and cleaned the DataFrames as necessary. The columns I utilized in my analysis are: `Sale Date`, `Quantity`, `Item Total`, `Date Shipped`, `Ship State`, `Ship Country`, `Processing Time`, `Rating`, `Review`, `Review Category`, `Sentiment`, and `Sentiment Category`.

- `Item Total`: the total price of the sale
- `Date Shipped`: the date the order was shipped out
